- forgot to include saving the results for each case, not just the best one, for a set of monte carlo simulations that took about 15 hours to run. at least it works, though? see `attempt_01/images`. images are in a separate folder because there was supposed to be another one with tables like for `demo_001` but i forgot to save those :) pain

- also an online acquaintance pointed out i should add **/__pycache__ and .idea to .gitignore which is KIND OF EMBARRASSING.
then again, like i said, been writing this at unreasonable hours so maaaaybe i should cut myself some slack

- anyway, next steps:
    - make sure to save all results for monte carlo sims
    - add more MC runs since i'm rerunning everything anyway
    - maybe use cython or numba to speed up the code? not sure if it's worth the effort
    - fix how the ETA is calculated or skip it altogether since it's always wrong
    - methods section for the thesis is in progress, add description of the demo 
    - figure out how to display results nicely in the thesis. for now i think i should put the best results in the main text and the rest in the appendix because there will be a shitton of data

music that keeps me sane recently:
- creepy nuts - gohotekitobikatanosusume 
- king gnu - specialz 
- yangyinyue - midu echoing
- boruto ost from that moment where naruto unlocks baryon mode

current state of mind: i opened my work laptop at 8:30 am on a sunday because i was sure it was monday. inshallah i'll get this degree
