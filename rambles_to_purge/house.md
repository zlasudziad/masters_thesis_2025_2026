- monte carlo ongoing. i forgot when i started it. it's been running for, uh, most of the day? i think? i forgot to include time tracking and the ETA is always wrong sooo
- gods above i feel like a rat out there, i make typos, i forgot to shower, been reading wikipedia articles on food instead of cooking, i lost the ability to communicate with mortals and i'm THIS close to crashing out like Gojo

CURSED ENERGY IS NEGATIVE ENERGY. WHILE IT CAN ENHANCE THE BODY, IT CAN'T REGENERATE IT. SO MULTIPLY THAT NEGATIVE ENERGY AGAINST ITSELF TO CREATE POSITIVE ENERGY. THAT'S THE REVERSE CURSED TECHNIQUE. EASIER SAID THAN DONE! I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT UP UNTIL NOW MYSELF! AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THE ONE PERSON WHO COULD DO IT SAID! BUT I FINALLY GRASPED IT ON THE VERGE OF DEATH! THE TRUE ESSENCE OF CURSED ENERGY!

yeah, basically this.

from positives, i contacted my supervisor to let him know i'm alive and working.

- forgot to include saving the results for each case, not just the best one, for a set of monte carlo simulations that took about 15 hours to run. at least it works, though? see `attempt_01/images`. images are in a separate folder because there was supposed to be another one with tables like for `demo_001` but i forgot to save those :) pain

- also an online acquaintance pointed out i should add `**/__pycache__` and `.idea` to .gitignore which is KIND OF EMBARRASSING.
then again, like i said, been writing this at unreasonable hours so maaaaybe i should cut myself some slack

- anyway, next steps:
    - [x] make sure to save all results for monte carlo sims
    - [x] add more MC runs since i'm rerunning everything anyway
    - [x] maybe use cython or numba to speed up the code? not sure if it's worth the effort (ETA not worth it)
    - [ ] fix how the ETA is calculated or skip it altogether since it's always wrong
    - [ ] methods section for the thesis is in progress, add description of the demo 
    - [ ] figure out how to display results nicely in the thesis. for now i think i should put the best results in the main text and the rest in the appendix because there will be a shitton of data

music that keeps me sane recently:
- creepy nuts - gohotekitobikatanosusume 
- king gnu - specialz 
- yangyinyue - midu echoing
- boruto ost from that moment where naruto unlocks baryon mode

current state of mind: i opened my work laptop at 8:30 am on a sunday because i was sure it was monday. inshallah i'll get this degree
